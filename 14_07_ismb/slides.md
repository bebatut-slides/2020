## Sam's story

Note:
- Sam
- PhD student working on the impact of gut microbiota on brain cell aging
- Background in biology, physiology, but not in bioinformatics
- Need to do RNA-Seq analyses for their PhD
- Ask a bioinformatician to do the analyses
- but Sam's bioinformaticians are always busy and don't have time to explain the different steps
- But Sam would like also to be able to understand what is done and discuss with them the results
- Need to learn how to analyze their data
- But afraid it could be too complicated

<!-- .slide: data-background="images/short_format.jpg" data-state="dim-background" -->

## Prefer short-format

Ideal to acquire or reinforce skills

Note:
- Rapid evolution of new technologies and approaches
- Difficult for formal training to stay up-to-date
- MOOC have fallen short
    - suffer from low completion rates
    - vary widely in scope, rigor, and approach
    - persist even when content is in error or obsolete
    - present difficulties for learners when they wish to interact and ask questions, especially in large courses, or when offered asynchronously
    - do not serve diverse learners equally, continuing patterns of inequity
- Short-format training
    - provides point-of-need training where participants learn skills they can immediately bring into practice
    - is often lower in time commitment and costs, making it more accessible than alternatives such as sabbaticals, online learning, or additional degrees
    - is focused on either foundational skills or rapidly emerging techniques

## Make training material FAIR

![](images/fair_training.png) <!-- .element width="70%" -->

<small>[Garcia et al, Plos Comp Biol, 2020](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007854) + Poster </small>

Note:
- 
Search for material
GTN
FAIR training
tess

Creating materials is a key task in the development of every training course. As trainers, we often turn to the internet for inspiration and/or to find existing training materials that can be adapted and reused. This search for materials can be a challenging and time consuming task. Within ELIXIR we saw an opportunity to improve this situation by translating the FAIR principles (that have been applied to data and software) into 10 simple rules to make training materials easier to find, access, reuse and cite.

These 10 simple steps are the beginning of a journey towards FAIRifying training materials and making them easier to find, share, reuse and cite. We hope that this inspires conversations and collaborations within global training communities that will lead to positive changes in the way we work and think about training. To learn more about the 10 steps you can read the paper in full in PLoS Computational Biology (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007854).

Note:
- Training sustainable if driven by a community: GTN, The Carpentries
    The Carpentries has reached more than 64,000 researchers through 2,562 workshops in 46 countries and assessment data suggests they are achieving sustainable impact. Their ability to accomplish this with an all-volunteer instructor core of more than 2,500 researchers also suggests both that SFT can be sustainable and can achieve global impact.
- Feeling supported: Life-Sci Trainers
Community of instructors to share the work, propagate, learn from each other (discussions, training philosophies)
- Transparent communication between us and with the community
